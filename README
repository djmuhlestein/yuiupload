YUI Image Uploader.

* Copy the editor code and initialization scripts from index.html to your own 
  page that you'd like the editor to appear on.

* Put the yui-image-uploaderXX.js script from /scripts on your server and make
  sure your path on the editor page correctly points to its location.

* Add backend programming support.  See

  for details and links.

Enjoy!
